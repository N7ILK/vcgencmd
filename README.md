# vcgencmd
vcgencmd replacement for running AllSky on Le Potato

This is a quick (bash) script I wrote while working to get AllSky functioning on Le Potato

It only supports the get_throttled command and partially recreates the hex output code based on current and past throttling as well as current over-temperature

Provided as-is
